It was written in Fortran on a PDP-10; there were about 700 lines each of code and data.  \nIn 1976, Don Woods found the program on a computer at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab and, after getting permission from Crowther, he expanded the program.  Jim Gillogly (Rand Corporation) and Walt Bilofsky, founder of The Software Toolworks (later  Mindscape), adapted the code for Heathkit and IBM personal computers and marketed it as \"The Original Adventure,\"  paying Crowther and Woods a small royalty after they endorsed it as the \"official\" version.

She added simple static line drawings, creating the first graphical adventure, Mystery House, with a plot based on Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. Her next game, The Wizard and the Princess: Adventure in Serenia, added fill color to the graphics.  \nWith King's Quest I, Sierra brought animated graphics to the genre. The characters could be moved behind  and in front of the objects in the scenery, which was drawn with perspective, giving the illusion of 3-D space. While Sierra would soon become the best-known developer of adventure games, the first release of King's Quest was a commercial failure. It became successful only after a long series of re-releases and improvements. Once King's Quest took off, Sierra branched into several franchises, including Space Quest, Police Quest, and Quest for Glory. \nParalleling Sierra's rise in adventure games was Lucasfilm Games, a competing company making similar games. Lucasfilm Games was able to tap into the franchises of its parent company, Lucasfilm, and produced a line of adventure games based around Indiana Jones. While it is likely best known for The Secret of Monkey Island, Lucasfilm produced many other popular and important adventure games, including Sam and Max, Day of the Tentacle, and Loom.   Maniac Mansion was the first game to remove typing text entirely from the adventure, and their Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion (SCUMM) was built to allow a point-and-click interface.\nBy 1990, Lucasfilm and Sierra had distinctly different adventure game philosophies. Sierra games contained many instant-death hazards, ranging from the obvious to the unexpected. Worse, avoiding those hazards was by no means a guarantee of success, as several Sierra games were notorious for situations where the player could simply miss a critical item, rendering the game unwinnable. \n\nConversely, Lucasfilm games were nearly impossible to lose. You were almost, if not entirely, guaranteed to be able to save the game at any point and know that you could still reach the ending. Several Lucasfilm games parodied the Sierra approach, with jokes poking fun at the ability to \"lose\", sometimes including fake Sierra-style death screens."}, {"image": "images/01272_1932_Japanese_pictorial_world_map_game_board.jpg", "image_id": "01272", "caption": "1932 Japanese pictorial world map game board"}, {"image": "images/01273_After_this_decline_came_the_rebirth_(6120459627).jpg", "image_id": "01273", "caption": "In 2001, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was released in Japan for the Game Boy Advance and achieved significant popularity. In 2005, it was re-released worldwide on the Nintendo DS, becoming an instant hit and spawning a pair of spinoff games. While not a classic Sierra or LucasArts style adventure game, the series borrows heavily from the basic ideas behind the genre.\nQuantic Dream had their own concept of a modern adventure game. In 2005, they released Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy in North America), an action thriller game with adventure foundations. In 2010 they followed up with Heavy Rain, an atmospheric noir thriller that received significant critical acclaim.\nTelltale Games secured the rights to Lucasfilm's classic Sam and Max adventure game series in 2006. They released a new episodic series, starting in late 2006 and continuing through 2007. Responses were generally, though not universally, positive, and the game was a commercial success.\nTelltale began work on a second Sam and Max adventure game series. After its release, they followed up with an adventure series based on the Homestar Runner franchise, then another based on Aardman Animation's Wallace and Gromit. Telltale also secured the classic Monkey Island franchise for yet another episodic series. The resurgence of interest encouraged LucasArts to re-release its classic adventure games on modern distribution networks.\n\nAdventure games have also regained popularity in the indie scene, although few have received significant press. Gemini Rue is a recent award-winning noir adventure game by Wadjet Eye Games, a studio responsible for several other excellent adventure games. The Chzo Mythos is a horror series released by Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw, and created with Adventure Game Studio (AGS), a free development tool for making interactive fiction. Another tool popular with hobbyists is the Text Adventure Development System (TADS). Although the industry as a whole seems hesitant to embrace the adventure game, good games are still being produced."}, {"image": "images/01274_Haroun_Haeder.png", "image_id": "01274", "caption": "Haroun Haeder's avater, First Appeared in 2019, in games like, Haroun Haeder 1, Haroun Haeder 2, 3, Haroun's Adventures, Haroun.exe, etc. (Discontinued)"}, {"image": "images/01275_The_Decline_(6121000478).jpg", "image_id": "01275", "caption": "By the late 1990s, the adventure game genre was in decline. Some credit this to Sierra's increasingly difficult games, which, by this point, nearly required a walkthrough to play. Lucasfilm games were still impossible to lose, but Lucasfilm had followed in Sierra's footsteps with puzzle difficulty, making them quite much harder to win. In 1990, Lucasfilm became part of LucasArts Entertainment Company, and in 1993 LucasArts became the name of the game division.\nGrim Fandango was released in 1998 and received many awards including GameSpot's Game of the Year as well as extremely positive reviews. Despite this, sales were quite low and it was a commercial failure, the first LucasArts game that did not make a profit. In the aftermath, both LucasArts and Sierra canceled games in development, citing a change in the market.\nThe classic adventure game genre stagnated after Grim Fandango. The previously-rapid release of new games became a slow trickle, with only a small handful of notable games released between 1999 and 2006. Despite the industry-wide slump, niche franchises survived. Her Interactive's Nancy Drew series, which began with the 1988 release of Secrets Can Kill, continued into its second decade of steady releases.\nThe enduring popularity of the earlier classic adventure games received an oblique compliment when Homestar Runner, an animated Internet cartoon, released a text adventure parody, Thy Dungeonman, in 2004, followed by Peasant's Quest, a parody of Sierra's Quest titles. Peasant's Quest used a system closely modeled on Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter, which was used to write the Quest games.\n\nAs the genre faded in the United States, it was on the rise in East Asia. Some of Japan's earliest games from the 1980s were bishoujo games (pretty girl games - a form of dating simulation) with eroge (erotic) content. In 1983 Portopia Serial Murder Case, a mystery, was released and set the stage for further development of the genre; Murder Club (also called J.B. Harold Murder Club) was one of the first released in the West (1986) and was received positively. In 2006, nearly 70% of PC games released in Japan were visual novel games. In an interesting reversal of the American tendency to convert movies into game franchises, these games are often adapted to become anime TV shows."}, {"image": "images/01277_Box_Ballyhoo_(1986).jpg", "image_id": "01277", "caption": "Box content of the text adventure Ballyhoo from 1986."}, {"image": "images/01278_Left_tower_-_top_(6121029898).jpg", "image_id": "01278", "caption": "The Longest Journey (2000)\nDeveloper: Funcom Productions A/S (Oslo)\nPublisher:   Funcom Productions A/S (Oslo)\n\n  Released in Norway in 1999, The Longest Journey was noted for its complex storyline, mature content, and exceptional graphics.

The soundtrack by Michael Land was augmented by hundreds of chord samples from Wagner's works arranged on synthesizer and was released separately on an audio CD.  \n  The history of The Dig is preserved online by the Dig Museum.

Specialists in industry seldom use the term cardboard because it does not denote a specific material. \nThe term cardboard may refer to a variety of heavy paper-like materials, including card stock, corrugated fiberboard, or paperboard. The meaning of the term may depend on the locale, contents, construction, and personal choice.\nIn business and industry, material producers, container manufacturers, packaging engineers, and standards organizations, try to use more specific terminology. There is still not complete and uniform usage. Often the term “cardboard” is avoided because it does not define any particular material.\nBroad divisions of paper-based packaging materials are:\n•\tPaper is thin material mainly used for writing upon, printing upon, or for packaging. It is produced by pressing together moist fibers, typically cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags, or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets.\n•\tPaperboard, sometimes known as cardboard, is generally thicker (usually over 0.25 mm or 10 points) than paper. According to ISO standards, paperboard is a paper with a basis weight (grammage) above 224 g/m², but there are exceptions. Paperboard can be single- or multi-ply.\n•\tCorrugated fiberboard sometimes known as corrugated board or corrugated cardboard, is a combined paper-based material consisting of a fluted corrugated medium and one or two flat liner boards.\n\n\nCrafts and entertainment\nCardboard and other paper-based materials (paperboard, corrugated fiberboard, etc.) can have a post-primary life as a cheap material for the construction of a range of projects, among them being science experiments, children's toys,costumes and insulative lining. Some children enjoy playing inside boxes.\nA common cliché is that, if presented with a large and expensive new toy, a child will quickly become bored with the toy and play with the box instead. Although this is usually said somewhat jokingly, children certainly enjoy playing with boxes, using their imagination to portray the box as an infinite variety of objects. One example of this from popular culture is Calvin of the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip, who often used a cardboard box for imaginative purposes from a \"transmogrifier\" to a time machine.\nSo prevalent is the cardboard box's reputation as a plaything that in 2005 a cardboard box was added to the National Toy Hall of Fame in the US, one of very few non-brand-specific toys to be honoured with inclusion. As a result, a toy \"house\" (actually a log cabin) made from a large cardboard box was added to the Hall, housed at the Strong - National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York.\nThe Metal Gear series of stealth video games has a running gag involving a cardboard box as an in-game item, which can be used by the player to try to sneak through places without getting caught by enemy sentries.\n\nHousing and furniture\nLiving in a cardboard box is stereotypically associated with homelessness. However, in 2005, Melbourne architect Peter Ryan designed a house composed largely of cardboard. More common are small seatings or little tables made from corrugated cardboard. Cardboard displays are often found in self-service shops.\n\nDamping by crushing\nMass and viscosity of the enclosed air help together with the limited stiffness of boxes to damp the velocity of oncoming objects. In 2012, British stuntman Gary Connery safely landed via wingsuit without deploying his parachute, landing on a 3.6 m high crushable \"runway\" (landing zone) built with thousands of cardboard boxes."}, {"image": "images/01475_Unturned.jpg", "image_id": "01475", "caption": "Logo for the Unturned video game on Steam."}, {"image": "images/01476_Shadow_of_survival.jpg", "image_id": "01476", "caption": "video game kings park"}, {"image": "images/01477_Light_gun_survival_horror_arcade_game.jpg", "image_id": "01477", "caption": "Survival Horror Light gun arcade gameTakuya gets the bad guys"}, {"image": "images/01479_Logo_Keplerians_horror_negro.jpg", "image_id": "01479", "caption": "The logo of Keplerians Horror Games."}, {"image": "images/01480_Banner_Horror_Night.jpg", "image_id": "01480", "caption": "Banner Horror Night"}, {"image": "images/01481_Gigamesh,_fantasy_and_science_fiction_bookstore_in_Barcelona.jpg", "image_id": "01481", "caption": "Gigamesh bookstore in Barcelona.
