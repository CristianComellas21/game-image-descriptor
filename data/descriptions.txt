I recently purchased this Centipede Cabaret Arcade Game. So far, I've washed it inside and outside with bleach and soap, removed the overlay, cleaned the glass, polished the wood, applied new side art and most importantly, replaced the incredibly rusted trackball.
Here is a video I made about how to replace a trackball in a Centipede...

The Nintendo Game Boy, a handheld gaming console released in 1989.  The relatively simple and monochrome Game Boy faced off against multiple handhelds and dominated the portable gaming market for almost a decade.  This system has a 4.19 MHz CPU, a 4-shade LCD and ran off of 4 AA batteries.  It was a very long-running system, only seeing a minor upgrade with the Game Boy Pocket in 1996, then later the Game Boy Color in 1998.

Inner workings of the Nintendo Switch with its hardware and the distribution of the components. Here you can see the mainboard, the battery, microchips and the fan of the System-on-a-Chip (NVIDIA Tegra). The black accumulator occupies a large part of the area. To the left you can see the fan that distributes the heat. The adjacent heat pipe conducts the heat from the thermal paste and the SoC to the fan. Above, below the heat pipe, are the headphone interface components. On the top left you can see the components of the Nintendo Switch game cards. On the left in the middle you can see the eMMC memory, which serves as internal memory. Bottom left is the MicroSD card reader area (not pictured) that overlies the sheet metal. To the right, under the thermal paste, is the NVIDIA Tegra SoC. To the right of the graphics chip is the LPDDR RAM in the form of 2 RAM chips, each offering 2 GB of memory. To the right of the RAM is the M92T36 643644 chip, which is supposed to control charging of electric current via USB-C. Below you can see the USB-C port. The 2R2 component on the right is used for the SMD power inductor. Components named "G6N20V4A 2D12B" can be seen at the bottom left and bottom right of the image.

The Nintendo 3DS XL handheld gaming console, shown opened.  The 3DS XL is a hardware revision of the original 3DS console, offered alongside the 3DS as an alternative model.  It is much larger than the 3DS, featuring screens that are 90% larger.  It was released worldwide in 2012, about a year and a half after the release of the original 3DS.  The system launched in America retailing at $199 and available in red or blue, with other colors and special editions released later.  The interior of the 3DS XL is entirely black on most models and the outer shell is colored.

The 3DS platform is Nintendo's followup to the Nintendo DS handheld.  Like the DS, it features a similar clamshell design, two screens for gaming and a bottom, touch-sensitive screen that uses an included stylus.  New additions are higher resolution screens, an analog slider pad, better graphics and a top screen that displays glasses-free 3D imaging.  The 3DS is backwards compatible with the DS.

Akihabara 1995. Constantly working part time back in London enabled me to save enough dosh to buy a ticket to come to Japan once a year. The trips were essential for me to absorb and learn more of the culture and leave me with that horrible feeling of going back to the UK. But that feeling only served as fuel for me to try harder with my Japanese studies.It was around this time when Akihabara started to see the popularity take off for adult PC games starring cute 2D girlies - the beginnings of Akihabara turning into a sacred land for Otaku and Japanese Pop Culture.

The Neo Geo CD was a conversion of the original Neo Geo AES hardware into a system with cheaper, more accessible media.  The original AES used large cartridges that cost hundreds of dollars each, whereas this model used common CDs that cost pennies to produce.  The system also included a more standard gamepad for the pack-in controller.

Well, the new guitar stand I just bought from Guitar Center is nothing fancy.
It is not the cheapest, nor the most expensive one... it is just one they used thoughtout the Guitar Center. $15+tax.
Looking at this picture, my guitar's bottom seems bigger than before. Hmmm, it has to go for a diet now... otherwise, I will dump it, and to get a Les Paul. :)
I have been browsing the web and drooling on the keyboard for a Gibson LP. ... Hmm... where can I get e-guitar lessons? Let me know... not a lot of budget.

The bare motherboard of a Funtech Super A'can gaming console, seen from an angle.  Released in 1995, the Super A'can was only available in Taiwan where it performed poorly.  This motherboard photo shows how it was made from off-the-shelf components, with a Motorola 68000 CPU running at 10MHz.  The console uses standard audio/video (composite/stereo) hookups and is powered by an external DC adapter.  The controller ports are standard DE-9, the same seen in early Atari/Commodore/Sega consoles.  The console contains a side expansion port, very similar to the Sega Genesis, though no add-ons were ever released for it.

Each row represents a guess; after each guess, the letters are marked with gray (if the letter is not in the answer), yellow (if the letter is in the answer but a different position), or green (if the letter is in the correct position.)

Author: Willie Crowther
Colossal Cave Adventure (often called Colossal Cave or Adventure) was the first adventure game and inspired all the adventures that came after it. 
Drawing on his experiences playing Dungeons and Dragons and as a caver, Willie Crowther decided to create a game based on exploring Mammoth Cave in Kentucky to entertain his daughters, whom he was missing after his divorce.  It was written in Fortran on a PDP-10; there were about 700 lines each of code and data.  
In 1976, Don Woods found the program on a computer at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab and, after getting permission from Crowther, he expanded the program.  Jim Gillogly (Rand Corporation) and Walt Bilofsky, founder of The Software Toolworks (later  Mindscape), adapted the code for Heathkit and IBM personal computers and marketed it as "The Original Adventure,"  paying Crowther and Woods a small royalty after they endorsed it as the "official" version.  Players who completed the game received a secret code which they could send to the company and receive a "Certificate of Wizardness."

After playing Colossal Cave Adventure, Roberta Williams looked for similar games and, when none were to be found, she decided to write her own with husband Ken Williams doing the coding.  She added simple static line drawings, creating the first graphical adventure, Mystery House, with a plot based on Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. Her next game, The Wizard and the Princess: Adventure in Serenia, added fill color to the graphics.  
With King's Quest I, Sierra brought animated graphics to the genre. The characters could be moved behind  and in front of the objects in the scenery, which was drawn with perspective, giving the illusion of 3-D space. While Sierra would soon become the best-known developer of adventure games, the first release of King's Quest was a commercial failure. It became successful only after a long series of re-releases and improvements. Once King's Quest took off, Sierra branched into several franchises, including Space Quest, Police Quest, and Quest for Glory. 
Paralleling Sierra's rise in adventure games was Lucasfilm Games, a competing company making similar games. Lucasfilm Games was able to tap into the franchises of its parent company, Lucasfilm, and produced a line of adventure games based around Indiana Jones. While it is likely best known for The Secret of Monkey Island, Lucasfilm produced many other popular and important adventure games, including Sam and Max, Day of the Tentacle, and Loom.   Maniac Mansion was the first game to remove typing text entirely from the adventure, and their Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion (SCUMM) was built to allow a point-and-click interface.
By 1990, Lucasfilm and Sierra had distinctly different adventure game philosophies. Sierra games contained many instant-death hazards, ranging from the obvious to the unexpected. Worse, avoiding those hazards was by no means a guarantee of success, as several Sierra games were notorious for situations where the player could simply miss a critical item, rendering the game unwinnable. 

Conversely, Lucasfilm games were nearly impossible to lose. You were almost, if not entirely, guaranteed to be able to save the game at any point and know that you could still reach the ending. Several Lucasfilm games parodied the Sierra approach, with jokes poking fun at the ability to "lose", sometimes including fake Sierra-style death screens.

In 2001, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was released in Japan for the Game Boy Advance and achieved significant popularity. In 2005, it was re-released worldwide on the Nintendo DS, becoming an instant hit and spawning a pair of spinoff games. While not a classic Sierra or LucasArts style adventure game, the series borrows heavily from the basic ideas behind the genre.
Quantic Dream had their own concept of a modern adventure game. In 2005, they released Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy in North America), an action thriller game with adventure foundations. In 2010 they followed up with Heavy Rain, an atmospheric noir thriller that received significant critical acclaim.
Telltale Games secured the rights to Lucasfilm's classic Sam and Max adventure game series in 2006. They released a new episodic series, starting in late 2006 and continuing through 2007. Responses were generally, though not universally, positive, and the game was a commercial success.
Telltale began work on a second Sam and Max adventure game series. After its release, they followed up with an adventure series based on the Homestar Runner franchise, then another based on Aardman Animation's Wallace and Gromit. Telltale also secured the classic Monkey Island franchise for yet another episodic series. The resurgence of interest encouraged LucasArts to re-release its classic adventure games on modern distribution networks.

Adventure games have also regained popularity in the indie scene, although few have received significant press. Gemini Rue is a recent award-winning noir adventure game by Wadjet Eye Games, a studio responsible for several other excellent adventure games. The Chzo Mythos is a horror series released by Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw, and created with Adventure Game Studio (AGS), a free development tool for making interactive fiction. Another tool popular with hobbyists is the Text Adventure Development System (TADS). Although the industry as a whole seems hesitant to embrace the adventure game, good games are still being produced.

By the late 1990s, the adventure game genre was in decline. Some credit this to Sierra's increasingly difficult games, which, by this point, nearly required a walkthrough to play. Lucasfilm games were still impossible to lose, but Lucasfilm had followed in Sierra's footsteps with puzzle difficulty, making them quite much harder to win. In 1990, Lucasfilm became part of LucasArts Entertainment Company, and in 1993 LucasArts became the name of the game division.
Grim Fandango was released in 1998 and received many awards including GameSpot's Game of the Year as well as extremely positive reviews. Despite this, sales were quite low and it was a commercial failure, the first LucasArts game that did not make a profit. In the aftermath, both LucasArts and Sierra canceled games in development, citing a change in the market.
The classic adventure game genre stagnated after Grim Fandango. The previously-rapid release of new games became a slow trickle, with only a small handful of notable games released between 1999 and 2006. Despite the industry-wide slump, niche franchises survived. Her Interactive's Nancy Drew series, which began with the 1988 release of Secrets Can Kill, continued into its second decade of steady releases.
The enduring popularity of the earlier classic adventure games received an oblique compliment when Homestar Runner, an animated Internet cartoon, released a text adventure parody, Thy Dungeonman, in 2004, followed by Peasant's Quest, a parody of Sierra's Quest titles. Peasant's Quest used a system closely modeled on Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter, which was used to write the Quest games.

As the genre faded in the United States, it was on the rise in East Asia. Some of Japan's earliest games from the 1980s were bishoujo games (pretty girl games - a form of dating simulation) with eroge (erotic) content. In 1983 Portopia Serial Murder Case, a mystery, was released and set the stage for further development of the genre; Murder Club (also called J.B. Harold Murder Club) was one of the first released in the West (1986) and was received positively. In 2006, nearly 70% of PC games released in Japan were visual novel games. In an interesting reversal of the American tendency to convert movies into game franchises, these games are often adapted to become anime TV shows.

Early adventure games were frequently played via terminal systems, simple keyboard/display combinations that connected to an expensive central computer usually owned by a university or a large company. The terminal communicated with the server via an early modem. The earliest modems didn't connect directly to the phone jack, they used a device known as an "acoustic coupler" - literally a cradle that you would place the phone handset in, with a speaker and microphone set up to "talk" to the phone in binary. 
The Dial-a-Grue device is the creation of Mitch Patenaude. It consists of an original unmodified terminal connected via a classic-style phone with a retrofitted amplifier which receives its data from an unmodified acoustically coupled modem. Although the modem talks to a coaster-sized modern computer running the actual game through Ubuntu Linux, the overall impression is very similar to the method that people would have originally used to run Zork. 

A future version of Dial-a-Grue is intended to build the game hardware into the phone itself, eliminating the modem and the external computer entirely.

Space Quest V: The Next Mutation (1993)
Developer: Dynamix, Inc. 
Publisher:  Sierra On-Line, Inc.

  In Roger Wilco's latest adventure, "He's Lean, He's Mean, and He's out to Clean..."
  Mark Crowe moved to Dynamix after Sierra bought it in 1990.  Space Quest V was the first Space Quest not designed by the "Two Guys From Andromeda;" Crowe designed it himself at Dynamix, while Scott Murphy moved on to other things at Sierra.  
  Space Quest V was the second Sierra game to have paid product placement from Sprint (the first was Leisure Suit Larry) , displaying the Sprint logo on billboards and after communications sequences in the game.  The enclosed copy of tabloid newspaper Galactic Inquirer contains hints, ads that are typical of  comic book ads, and articles about how a game is supposedly made.  
  The game is perceived by some as primarily a Star Trek spoof, and it is rife with Trek allusions.  There are other popular culture references throughout, including Flash Gordon, Einstein, Elvis, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader, and "cameos" for other games including Pong,  PacMan, and Asteroids.

The Dig (1995)
Developer:  LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC
Publisher:    LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC

  The Dig is based on an idea Stephen Spielberg had for an episode on his TV series, Amazing Stories.  Work began in 1989 but the game was not released until 1995, setting a length of development record for a LucasArts adventure game.  It included Spielberg, Orson Scott Card (dialogue), and Brian Moriarty (Loom) in the writing credits.  There were four different project leaders until Sean Clark eventually completed the game.  It remains the only purely science fiction game made by LucasArts.  
  A novel based on the game was written by Alan Dean Foster, also released as an audio book.  The cover of the audio book shows four astronauts, a design from the Moriarty version of the game.  The later versions had three astronauts as shown on the final game cover. The soundtrack by Michael Land was augmented by hundreds of chord samples from Wagner's works arranged on synthesizer and was released separately on an audio CD.  
  The history of The Dig is preserved online by the Dig Museum. The Dig was re-released online by Steam in 2009.

Developer: LucasArts Entertainment Company 
Publisher:   LucasArts Entertainment Company 
The Monkey Island series grew out of designer Ron Gilbert's fondness for the ride "Pirate of the Caribbean" at Disneyland.  He wished he could get off the boat that carries you around 
the pirate adventure, so he created a game in which he could. Before this game started development, Gilbert had left LucasArts to form Humongous Entertainment. The Curse of Monkey Island was developed by designers Larry Ahern and Jonathan Ackley. 
The Curse of Monkey Island continued the LucasArts philosophy of "player friendly" games in which it is impossible to get stuck in an unwinnable condition.  The game also continues the tradition of in-jokes, spoofs, Easter eggs, and popular culture references; some websites are dedicated solely to finding these.
The music in the Monkey Island series, composed by Michael Land, received special acclaim and remains popular.  
Land, working with Peter McConnell, developed iMUSE (Interactive MUsic Streaming Engine) , an interactive music system that improved synchronization of music with the game action. It was first used in Monkey Island 2 and has since been used in every LucasArts game.

Creative toys are rare in many developing countries. These children enjoy their first opportunity to play with Tinkertoys, which a visitor to Laos brought from abroad and donated to Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project in Laos.
Because it's their first exposure to Tinkertoys, children tend to note what others are making, and then build something on a similar theme. At this event, spoked gadgets predominated. On another occasion, one boy linked together many wheels, to make a caterpillar-type creature that he pulled on the floor; soon other pull toys were created.

Cardboard boxes are industrially prefabricated boxes, primarily used for packaging goods and materials. Specialists in industry seldom use the term cardboard because it does not denote a specific material. 
The term cardboard may refer to a variety of heavy paper-like materials, including card stock, corrugated fiberboard, or paperboard. The meaning of the term may depend on the locale, contents, construction, and personal choice.
In business and industry, material producers, container manufacturers, packaging engineers, and standards organizations, try to use more specific terminology. There is still not complete and uniform usage. Often the term “cardboard” is avoided because it does not define any particular material.
Broad divisions of paper-based packaging materials are:
•	Paper is thin material mainly used for writing upon, printing upon, or for packaging. It is produced by pressing together moist fibers, typically cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags, or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets.
•	Paperboard, sometimes known as cardboard, is generally thicker (usually over 0.25 mm or 10 points) than paper. According to ISO standards, paperboard is a paper with a basis weight (grammage) above 224 g/m², but there are exceptions. Paperboard can be single- or multi-ply.
•	Corrugated fiberboard sometimes known as corrugated board or corrugated cardboard, is a combined paper-based material consisting of a fluted corrugated medium and one or two flat liner boards.


Crafts and entertainment
Cardboard and other paper-based materials (paperboard, corrugated fiberboard, etc.) can have a post-primary life as a cheap material for the construction of a range of projects, among them being science experiments, children's toys,costumes and insulative lining. Some children enjoy playing inside boxes.
A common cliché is that, if presented with a large and expensive new toy, a child will quickly become bored with the toy and play with the box instead. Although this is usually said somewhat jokingly, children certainly enjoy playing with boxes, using their imagination to portray the box as an infinite variety of objects. One example of this from popular culture is Calvin of the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip, who often used a cardboard box for imaginative purposes from a "transmogrifier" to a time machine.
So prevalent is the cardboard box's reputation as a plaything that in 2005 a cardboard box was added to the National Toy Hall of Fame in the US, one of very few non-brand-specific toys to be honoured with inclusion. As a result, a toy "house" (actually a log cabin) made from a large cardboard box was added to the Hall, housed at the Strong - National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York.
The Metal Gear series of stealth video games has a running gag involving a cardboard box as an in-game item, which can be used by the player to try to sneak through places without getting caught by enemy sentries.

Housing and furniture
Living in a cardboard box is stereotypically associated with homelessness. However, in 2005, Melbourne architect Peter Ryan designed a house composed largely of cardboard. More common are small seatings or little tables made from corrugated cardboard. Cardboard displays are often found in self-service shops.

Damping by crushing
Mass and viscosity of the enclosed air help together with the limited stiffness of boxes to damp the velocity of oncoming objects. In 2012, British stuntman Gary Connery safely landed via wingsuit without deploying his parachute, landing on a 3.6 m high crushable "runway" (landing zone) built with thousands of cardboard boxes.

Members of NOREX 43's White Platoon and the Staff/Leadership team were taken out to a nearby freshwater lake to conduct water survival techniques in a canoe. Even with a 62 degree air temperature and sunny skies, the frigid water temperature provided a very real experience in a "what if" scenario for the Minnesota National Guardsmen. Other activities included making a Norwegian Troll, boatmanship in a canoe, a Survival race competition and an opportunity to take a very brisk field-bath. Later that night back in camp, traditional Norwegian games brought out the "Viking" competitiveness in the Minnesota service members. (Minnesota National Guard photos by: Tech. Sgt. Paul Santikko)
